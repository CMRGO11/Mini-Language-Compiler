# Mini Language Compiler  
**Python-based educational compiler with Lexer → Parser → AST → TAC pipeline**

This project implements a simplified compiler for a small imperative language.  
It includes the following phases:

- **Lexical Analysis**
- **Syntactic Analysis (Recursive Descent Parser)**
- **AST Construction**
- **Semantic Analysis (stub for future expansion)**
- **TAC (Three-Address Code) Generation**
- **(Simulated) TAC Execution**

The project also contains a **suite of 12 tests** covering declarations, assignments, arithmetic, boolean expressions, control flow, semantic errors, and integration programs.

This compiler was developed as part of an academic project.
